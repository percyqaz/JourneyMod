# What's this?

Now that Terraria ~~1.4.1.2~~ ~~1.4.2.3~~ ~~1.4.3.6~~ 1.4.4.2 has released and is ***supposedly*** the final patch for the game, I want to fully research every (obtainable) item in Terraria in Journey Mode.

----

🚧 There is no release for 1.4.4.2 because they refactored the recipe code and the tool cannot rewrite recipes on the fly correctly any more

I got around this by modifying my Terraria.exe directly, but obviously I cannot redistribute that

If at some point I get around to it, this tool will become either a proper tmodloader mod or some kind of binary patch you can make to your exe

Until then you are out of luck, only I have a full working version for 1.4.4.2

The code remains here in case it is useful to anyone

----

The Journey Mode GUI is a bit cumbersome and it can take a long time just going through recipes, crafting them, researching them, etc etc and so I have made a tool to greatly assist in this process.

This also regears the game towards having to fully research an item before you can use it at all.

# How does it work?
- Terraria.exe is not obfuscated
- Run Terraria's main game thread from inside the program
- Run another thread alongside it
- Poke at the publicly exposed Terraria variables to achieve desired results from the extra thread

# Features
- Auto-deletion of any items you pick up that are already researched (can be turned off)
- Auto-research of any items you pick up that are not already researched (cannot be turned off to make it challenging/fun)
* When an item is auto-researched and this completes the research, the item stays in your inventory so you can check it out
- Click any item in your inventory to auto-research it if not already researched
- Favourited items become infinite stacks
## Additional powers via commands
- Tools to export item lists, recipe lists, your character's research data as CSV files if you want to spreadsheet that stuff
- If you have researched an item, all crafting recipes involving it behave as if you have infinite in your inventory
- If you have researched an item, all crafting recipes FOR it are disabled
- Ability to auto-research every recipe at your current crafting station(s) if all ingredients are researched
- Ability to copy a research-share-code to your clipboard, if someone else is using the mod they can use it add your research library to theirs! (Good for doing this in multiplayer)

# How do I use it?
- Put the .exe in your Terraria folder (steamapps/common, Where Terraria.exe is)
- Run it (may have to try twice / run as administrator)

* For commands while ingame on a journey mode character, type `/[COMMAND]/` into the chat box to run a command
* todo: Document what commands are available - for now look at Program.cs

**If you find this repository and it looks useful but you can't get it working/want to know how the commands work, you're welcome to open an issue and I will write the documentation properly**
